# Linguistic DNA
Final project work by Roger Hauber, Marie Hartmann, Friedolin Marsch, and Jana Wilbert

## What is Linguistic DNA?
Linguistic DNA is based on a deep learning model that classifies audio of English language speech by accent and provides the breakdown of the classification to the user - a Linguistic DNA test so to speak.

## What is the current status of Linguistic DNA?
A first prototype classifying five different accents was fully working and online as the final project of a data science bootcamp (March 2023). Currently, the documents are being tidied up and the model / front-end will be successively improved.

## Which data is Linguistic DNA based on?
Data was used from the Mozilla common voice dataset (Common Voice Corpus 6.1): https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets
